# 🚀 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Animation using AI  

This project visualizes the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using AI-based optimization techniques. The animation dynamically showcases how the algorithm finds the shortest route connecting multiple cities.  

## 📌 Features  

- **AI-Powered Optimization** – Uses intelligent algorithms to solve TSP efficiently.  
- **Smooth Animation** – Step-by-step visualization of the pathfinding process.  
- **Dynamic Interaction** – Watch the algorithm refine the route in real-time.  
- **Scalability** – Supports different numbers of cities for experimentation.  

## 🖥️ Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language**: Python / JavaScript (Specify which one you used)  
- **Libraries Used**: (e.g., Matplotlib, D3.js, Pygame, TensorFlow, etc.)  
- **Algorithm**: Genetic Algorithm / Simulated Annealing / Neural Networks (Mention the approach)  

## 🚀 Installation  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tsp-ai-animation.git
cd tsp-ai-animation
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If Python is used
```

## ▶️ Usage  

Run the main script to start the animation:  

```bash
python main.py
```

Or, if it’s a web-based visualization:  

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
